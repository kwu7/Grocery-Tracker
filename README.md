# Grocery-Tracker
## What
An app that keeps track of your groceries by displaying the cost and quantity the user inputs, sets a budget the user inputs, calculates total cost, and tracks total cost in comparison to the budget.
## Why
Many people enter grocery stores without knowing what to buy and how much to buy. This can be problematic, because people can spend more than they intend to. The goal of this app is to monitor groceries and spending to maximize shopping efficiency and to spend less.
## How
Using Android Studio, we plan on creating a meats tab, a polutrary tab, and a miscalanious tab - to organize and display the list. We will also take user input - regarding maximum budget, quantity, cost, and specific grocery.
